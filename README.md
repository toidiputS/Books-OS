  **A massive, high-performance 3D spatial knowledge environment.**
  *240 Shelves. 2,400 Books. Infinite Context.*

## 🌌 The Vision
**Books OS** is more than a library; it's a spatial operating system for knowledge. Designed with a "No Hero, No Guru, Just a New You" philosophy, it provides an immersive, high-ticket environment for interacting with vast quantities of data, artifacts, and logs.

Whether you're exploring the 20-level vertical stacks or interacting with the "Spec" books (A-J) of **itsaiagent.solutions**, Books OS provides a premium, responsive, and aesthetically driven experience.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🏛️ Massive 3D Library Architecture**: Navigate a cylindrical tower featuring 240 distinct shelf sectors and 2,400 interactive books.
- **🌪️ Vortex Dynamics**: Experience an organic "book vortex." Books float, orbit, and tumble through space, responding to user interaction.
- **📖 Rich Overlays**: Specialized data-driven overlays for canonical books (A-J), featuring specific chapters with complex UI segments (fields, code blocks, stats, and lists).
- **🪪 Identity Protocol**: User authentication via the "Library Card" system, integrated directly into the 3D world at the Master Desk.
- **🕹️ Hybrid Controls**: 
  - **Desktop**: WASD + Mouse look with Pointer Lock.
  - **Mobile**: Fully responsive on-screen d-pad and action buttons.
- **⚡ High-Performance Rendering**: Optimized with shared geometries and memoized state selectors to handle thousands of objects at 60fps.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: [React](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Graphics**: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) via [@react-three/fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) & [@react-three/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)
- **State**: [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) (with LocalStorage persist)
- **UI/Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Audio**: Text-to-Speech greeting protocols
